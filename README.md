# Article Similarity Graph

The **Article Similarity Graph** is a tool designed to help you visually explore how different articles relate to one central article. It enables easy navigation through related content, showing which articles are more or less connected to your topic of interest.

## Features

- **Central Focus**: The main article appears at the center of the graph, with related articles positioned around it. The closer an article is to the center, the more similar it is to the main topic.

- **Clustering and Zooming**:
    - As you zoom out, closely related articles automatically **group into clusters**. These clusters appear as larger circles, making it easier to view groups of similar articles without clutter.
    - When you zoom back in, the clusters **separate into individual articles** again for detailed exploration.

- **Interactive Exploration**:
    - Hover over articles or clusters to see titles and additional information.

## Benefits

- **Quickly Identify Related Articles**: Instantly see which articles are most similar to your central topic.
- **Identify Content Clusters**: Zoom out to spot natural groupings of articles, giving a big-picture view of related topics.
- **Flexible, User-Friendly Navigation**: Move seamlessly between detailed and big-picture views, exploring content in an intuitive, organized way.

The Article Similarity Graph offers a powerful and professional way to analyze connections between topics, helping you discover insights and navigate content with ease.
